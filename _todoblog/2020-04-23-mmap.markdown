# Page Cache

四类page：

+ 读取mmap的文件时，发生page fault后加载的page；
+ 按Block读取块设备或filesys时，加载的buffer page；
+ page cache中的特别区域——swap cache的Anonymous page；
+ shared-memory中的page。

Page Cache构成

+ **inode queue**：包含三个list，

  + clean_pages
  + dirty_pages
  + locked_pages

+ **page cache hash table**：mm/filemap.c `struct page **page_hash_table`

+ **LRU lists**：包含两个list（mm/page_alloc.c）：

  + (hot)active_list：
  + (cold)inactive_list

  有pagemap_lru_lock这个自旋锁控制并发；通过`refill_inactive`将active list中的page转移到inactive list中，保持active list是inactive list的2/3。

## 回收内存

shrink_cache负责释放一些内存空间，区别于上面的shrink_cache，shink_caches包含若干步，shrink_cache只是其中一步：

1. kmem_cache_reap
2. refill_inactive
3. shrink_cache
   1. swap_out
4. shrink_dcache_memory
5. shrink_icache_memory: Instructions and data have different access patterns.
6. shrink_dqcache_memory

swap out交给专门的守护进程——kswapd执行，一旦系统的free page数量小于pages_low，该进程就开始swap out。

> 4KB is an increase over what early virtual memory systems used; 512 bytes was once common. But it is still small relative to the both the amount of physical memory available on contemporary systems and the working set size of applications running on those systems. That means that the operating system has more pages to manage than it did some years back.

Benefit

+ the size of page tables decreases, as does the number of page faults required to get an application into RAM.  (decreasing page fault counts)

+ fewer translation lookaside buffer (TLB) slots

Drawback

+ internal fragmentation
+ high sparsely-accessed memory cost
+ increasing page fault latency

**interrupt request line**

 During the [boot process](https://manybutfinite.com/post/kernel-boot-process) the kernel programs a hardware timer to issue **timer interrupts** at a periodic interval,

**Interrupts are the most frequent and crucial entry point into the OS kernel.**

Memory mapping is a convenient and high-performance way to do file I/O, so it is used for loading dynamic libraries. It is also possible to create an **anonymous memory mapping** that does not correspond to any files, being used instead for program data. In Linux, if you request a large block of memory via [malloc()](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/malloc.3.html), the C library will create such an anonymous mapping instead of using heap memory.

```
Compaction(snaps, files):
// <snaps> is the set of snapshots (i.e.: a list of sequence numbers)
// <files> is the set of files undergoing compaction
Let input = a file composed of the union of all files
Let output = a file to store the resulting entries

Let stack = [];			// in reality, this should be a "deque", but stack is simpler to conceptualize in this pseudo-code
for each v from newest to oldest in input:
 clear_stack = false
 if v.sequence_number is in snaps:
   clear_stack = true
 else if stack not empty && v.key != stack.top.key:
   clear_stack = true

 if clear_stack:
   write out all operands on stack to output (in the same order as encountered)
   clear(stack)

 if v.type is "merge_operand":
   push v to stack
     while (stack has at least 2 elements and (stack.top and stack.second_from_top can be partial-merged)):
       v1 = stack.pop();
       v2 = stack.pop();
       result_v = client_merge_operator.PartialMerge(v1,v2)
       push result_v to stack
 if v.type is "put":
   write client_merge_operator.FullMerge(v, stack) to output
   clear stack
 if v.type is "delete":
   write client_merge_operator.FullMerge(nullptr, stack) to output
   clear stack

If stack not empty:
 if end-of-key-history for key on stack:
   write client_merge_operator.FullMerge(nullptr, stack) to output
   clear(stack)
 else
   write out all operands on stack to output
   clear(stack)

return output
```





**M_MMAP_THRESHOLD**

For allocations greater than or equal to the limit specified (in bytes) by **M_MMAP_THRESHOLD** that can't be satisfied from the free list, the memory-allocation functions employ **[mmap](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/mmap.2.html)**(2) instead of increasing the program break using **[sbrk](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/sbrk.2.html)**(2).



Allocating memory using **[mmap](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/mmap.2.html)**(2) has the significant advantage that the allocated memory blocks can always be independently released back to the system. (By contrast, the heap can be trimmed only if memory is freed at the top end.) On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to the use of **[mmap](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/mmap.2.html)**(2): deallocated space is not placed on the free list for reuse by later allocations; memory may be wasted because **[mmap](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/mmap.2.html)**(2) allocations must be page-aligned; and the kernel must perform the expensive task of zeroing out memory allocated via **[mmap](dfile:///Users/bytedance/Library/Application Support/Dash/User Contributed/Linux Man Pages/Linux.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/man2/mmap.2.html)**(2). Balancing these factors leads to a default setting of 128*1024 for the **M_MMAP_THRESHOLD**parameter.
