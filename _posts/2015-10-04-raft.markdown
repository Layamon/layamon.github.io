> 关于Chubby实现的一个评价，Paxos在实际使用的时候，都将原来的架构变了，来适应实际的环境，
> Paxos虽然是一个被证明的正确的分布式一致性理论，但是在实际使用的过程中难度较大，实现难
> Paxos uses a symmetric peer-to-peer approach at its core (though it eventually suggests a weak form of leadership as a performance optimization). 
> This makes sense in a simplified world where only one decision will be made, but few practical systems use this approach. 
> If a series of decisions must be made, it is simpler and faster to first elect a leader, then have the leader coordinate the decisions.
