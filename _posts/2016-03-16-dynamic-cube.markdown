Dynamic cubes consist of a collection of dimensions, representing dimension tables in the data source, and a single measure dimension, representing the fact table. There can be only one measure dimension in a dynamic cube, but there can be any number of regular dimensions in a cube.

The modeling exercise is to create the cube by deciding the fact table you want to use in the measure dimension of the cube, identify the dimensions you want, their grain to the fact table, and establish relationships between them and the cube’s measure dimension.

Dimensions: 
    + measure : 
    + regular :
    + time :
    + parent-child:
        
Hierarchy:
    a structure that organizes and relates the attributes of a dimension into layers of increasing level of detail from the most abstract to the most concrete
